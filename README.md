## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

npm run dev
```

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
PORT=8080
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

## Usage

### Web Interface

The scraper includes a minimal web UI for easy testing:

1. Start the server: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
3. Enter a product URL and select scraping strategy
4. View the structured JSON output

### HTTP API

#### Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

#### Scrape Single Page

```bash
# POST request with JSON body
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/scrape \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com/product/123", "strategy": "fingerprint", "useAI": true}'
```

#### Direct URL Scraping

```bash
# GET request with URL parameter
curl "http://localhost:8080/scrape/https%3A//example.com/product/123?strategy=fingerprint&ai=true"
```

## API Response Format

    "images": ["https://example.com/image1.jpg"],
    "html": "<html>...</html>"
  }
}
```

## Performance Optimizations

- **Resource Blocking**: Blocks unnecessary resources (images, CSS, fonts) during scraping
- **Browser Caching**: Reuses browser instances for faster subsequent requests
- **Request Interception**: Optimizes network requests for speed
- **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts to prevent hanging requests
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against abuse

## Supported Ecommerce Platforms

The scraper is designed to work with most ecommerce platforms including:

- Shopify stores
- WooCommerce sites
- Magento stores
- Custom ecommerce platforms
- Amazon (basic support)
- eBay (basic support)

## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling:

- Network timeouts
- Invalid URLs
- Blocked requests
- AI processing failures
- Graceful degradation to fallback extraction

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```
